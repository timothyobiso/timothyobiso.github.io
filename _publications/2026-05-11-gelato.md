This paper introduces GELATO (Government, Executive, Legislative, and Treaty Ontology), a dataset of U.S.
House and Senate bills from the 118th Congress annotated using a novel two-level named entity recognition
ontology designed for U.S. legislative texts. We fine-tune transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) of different
architectures and sizes on this dataset for first-level prediction. We then use LLMs with optimized prompts to
complete the second level prediction. The strong performance of RoBERTa and relatively weak performance of
BERT models, as well as the application of LLMs as second-level predictors, support future research in legislative
NER or downstream tasks using these model combinations as extraction tools.
