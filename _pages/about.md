Hello! I am a PhD student studying Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University. I recently defended my Master's Thesis, "Holographic Embeddings for Text and Graphs" with High Honors! I am currently working on projects related to HRR/VSA, semantic interpretability, social deduction and alignment, and epistemic planning!
